# COVID-19 vaccination and future birth outcomes: findings from an England-wide cohort study of 186,990 women vaccinated before pregnancy

## Project description

COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy is recommended by the World Health Organisation as effective and safe. However, there remains a lack of robust evidence to inform vaccination choices for women of childbearing potential in relation to their future pregnancies.

Here we investigated the association between starting a course of COVID-19 vaccination before pregnancy and future birth outcomes.
